# Ralix Vision and Philosophy

Ralix aims to provide barebones and utilities to help enhance your current Rails HTML. It pairs really well with Turbolinks.

Following the spirit of frameworks like [Stimulus](https://github.com/stimulusjs/stimulus), Ralix doesn't seek to take over your entire front-end. Instead, it's designed to augment your HTML with just enough behavior to make it shine.

## Logo

We use a bear, a sloth bear, inspired by Baloo (from The Jungle Book) performing the song "The Bare Necessities".
